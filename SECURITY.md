# Security Guidelines

## Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `.env.example` files to document required variables
- Rotate credentials immediately if accidentally exposed

## Database Security
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Restrict database access by IP
- Use connection pooling limits
- Enable database encryption at rest

## API Security
- All sensitive endpoints require authentication
- Rate limiting is enabled by default
- CORS is configured for specific origins
- Input validation on all endpoints

## Production Deployment
- Use environment-specific `.env` files
- Enable HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Set up proper logging and monitoring
- Regular security audits

## Emergency Response
If credentials are exposed:
1. Immediately rotate/change all passwords
2. Update `.env` files with new credentials
3. Remove sensitive data from git history
4. Monitor for unauthorized access
5. Update IP restrictions
